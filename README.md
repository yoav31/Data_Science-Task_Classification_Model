# Titanic Survival Prediction

Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using a PyTorch neural network and visualize results in a Streamlit app.

---

## Description
This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning pipeline:
- Load and preprocess the Titanic dataset (train.csv from Kaggle)
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) with plots
- Train a PyTorch classification model
- Evaluate the model on a held-out validation set
- Visualize results and run inference in Streamlit
